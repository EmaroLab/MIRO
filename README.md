# MIRO

This repository holds files describing how to setup [MiRo](http://consequentialrobotics.com/miro/)

Look into the folder MIRO_quick_instructions for quick instructions :)
1. ROS installation
2. Workstation (laptop) setup as ROS master
3. MiRo setup as ROS node
    
Also in this repository, you can find:
1. The file mdk-180509.tgz, i.e., the latest MiRo mdk, which can also be [found here](http://labs.consequentialrobotics.com/miro/mdk/)
2. The folder MIRO_simple_python_code which contains miro_touch_control.py, i.e., a simple python code to get accustomed with 'subscribing from' and 'publishing to' MiRo's ROS topics.
