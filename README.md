# MIRO

This repository holds files describing how to setup [MiRo](http://consequentialrobotics.com/miro/)

Look into the folder MIRO_quick_instructions for quick instructions :)
1. ROS installation
2. Workstation (laptop) setup as ROS master
3. MiRo setup as ROS node
    
Also in this repository, you can find:
* The folder MIRO_simple_python_code which contains miro_touch_control.py, i.e., a simple python code to get accustomed with 'subscribing from' and 'publishing to' MiRo's ROS topics.

To download MiRo's mdk you can:
1. go to the [official website](http://labs.consequentialrobotics.com/miro/mdk/), OR
2. from the terminal do `git clone https://gitlab.com/yushakareem/miro_mdk.git` and then in the same directory extract by typing `tar xvzf mdk-180509.tgz`
