# uncomment these values to configure MIRO to run encapsulated
# "on-board", so the ROS master runs here as do ROS nodes.
#ROS_IP=127.0.0.1
#ROS_MASTER_IP=localhost

# if those values were not set, you can configure MIRO to use
# an off-board ROS master, in this section.

    	# before ROS servers & clients are started, the value ROS_IP
        # must be set so that remote systems can find this node.
        #
        # if you leave ROS_IP blank, here, get_ROBOT_IP.sh can be
        # used to set it dynamically as ROS nodes are being started
        # (see run_bridge_ros.sh for an example).
        #
        # if you are using a static IP for your robot, you can as an
        # alternative set ROS_IP, here, to that IP and then you do
        # not need to run get_ROBOT_IP.sh when launching ROS nodes.
        #ROS_IP=192.168.1.101
        #
        # IP address of ROS master is needed so we can find it when
        # we start any ROS node locally. you should always set this
        # value if we are not running the ROS master locally.
